### Purpose
This project's purpose is to utilize our team's big data skills (specifically the Apache Spark ecosystem) to collect and perform analyses 
on a dataset gathered from the Meetup.com API. Our focus was to determine trends about groups and their events focused around technology. 
Data gathering and pruning was also performed by the team. 

### Goals
Analysis questions and goals are:
- How many events were created for each month and year?
- How many upcoming events are being hosted online compared to in-person?
- What is the trend of events about new technologies vs. older ones?
- Which cities hosted the most technology-based events? Which venues?
- What are some of the most common event topics?
- What is the most popular time when events are created?
- Are events with longer durations more popular than those with shorter durations?
- Has there been a change in planning period time for events?
- Which events have the most RSVPs?
- How has event capacity changed over the months/years?
- What is the preferred payment method for events?
- How has the average cost of events changed over time?
- What are the largest tech groups in the dataset?
